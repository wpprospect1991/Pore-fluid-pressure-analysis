# Pore-fluid-pressure-analysis

This code can be used to analysis the effects of wave-induced pore fluid pressures (including crack and stiff pore pressures) on fluid-saturated rocks. 

Pore fluid pressure is affected by seismic wave propagation and also constrained by the complex reservoir petrophysical properties. The former is the wavefield macroscopic response, while the latter is the reservoir microscopic details. Thus, the pore fluid pressure can act as a link between them. To elucidate the impact of reservoir petrophysical properties on pore fluid pressure, a poroelastic theory is developed by using the inclusion-based framework. Building on this theory, we introduced a relative fluid pressure parameter (σ_i^r), which facilitates a detailed analysis of the effects of key reservoir petrophysical properties, including rock inhomogeneity, permeability, and fluid viscosity. 

The Variations of P-wave modulus (M) with the relative fluid pressures of crack (σ_c^r) and stiff pore (σ_p^r) at different porosities (por) are shown below:
